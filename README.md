## üîç Overview

This project focuses on segmenting credit card users based on their spending behaviors and credit card usage patterns. By applying advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, the aim is to provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies and personalized financial services.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset was loaded from Google Cloud Platform using BIGQUERY with the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM
    `project-table.credit-card-information`
WHERE (MOD(CUST_ID,2) != 0)
ORDER BY CUST_ID;
```

The dataset used in this project contains information about credit card users. Here's a breakdown of the columns:

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method
- Normalized the data using log transformation

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed the distribution of each feature
- Identified correlations between features
- Visualized key insights using heatmaps and box plots

## üéØ Feature Selection

- Used correlation analysis to identify highly correlated features
- Selected relevant features for clustering

## üìâ Dimensionality Reduction

- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset
- Determined the optimal number of components to retain

## üßÆ Clustering

- Used the Elbow method and Silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Applied K-means clustering algorithm with k=3
- Initialized centroids using k-means++ method

## üìè Model Evaluation

- Evaluated the clustering results using silhouette score
- Visualized the clusters using box plots for each feature

## üìà Results

The analysis revealed three distinct user segments:

1. Lower-income or conservative credit users
2. Moderate balance users with high cash advance frequency
3. High-income, high-spending users

These insights can be leveraged for targeted marketing campaigns and product development.
